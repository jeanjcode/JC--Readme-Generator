# JC README Generator

## Description

The JC README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input (using the Inquirer package).

When a user is prompted for information, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

- The title of project
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions






## Installation

Make sure that your project includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

1. Run 'npm init' to first set up the project 

2. Then ' npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0' to install the  inquirer module  




## Usage
1. Right click on 'index.js' and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'. 

2. Type 'node index.js' and enter.

3. You will be given a series of prompts to answer. Each answer you give will displayed in the your README file.

4. After the final question, the generated README file can be found in the 'app template' folder.
