# JC README Generator

## Description

The JC README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input (using the Inquirer package).

When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

- The title of project
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions




<br>

## Installation


The following walkthrough video, demonstrates its functionality.

- Link to [link](https://drive.google.com/file...)
- Link to github repo

<br>

## Usage
<br>

Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.




<br>

When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
